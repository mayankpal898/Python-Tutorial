# Variables
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Creating Variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
# x is of type int
x = 4       
# x is now of type str
x = "Sally" 
print(x)
# Get the Type
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
# Case-Sensitive
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
print(a)
print(A)

# Slicing
# You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
# Slice From the Start
# By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])
# Slice To the End
# By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])
# Negative Indexing
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
